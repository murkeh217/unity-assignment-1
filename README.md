Assignment Details : 

Make a generic UI implementation for a Leaderboard using Object Pooling.
1. Total number of Entries - 1002. 
2. Entries visible at a time - 103. 
3. The List view should start directly at 50th rank (keep this as a public variable)
4. Prefab should be loaded through Asset Bundle.
5. Object Pooling is generic, so that it can be used in other places as well.
